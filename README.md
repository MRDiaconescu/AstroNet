Before you copy and/or distribute this program against the terms stated in the license, please be aware of the consequences.

This program illustrates a design pattern that uses the graph data structure and classes to create a robust network implementation.
It comprises of multiple functions which are used in conjunction with each other to tighten the relations that exist between
the classes and inside a graph.

It can not be controlled entirely by the person that might run it because to build the networks it uses sets which are involved in many operations
and the system arranges the networks on its own, at a certain phase.

The most important class is the Account class, which is used as a substrate for performing operations between networks and inside the graphs.

The program follows a design pattern which has the structure of a labirinth and when the user thinks that the program has completely executed, 
there are functions which interfere with the termination of the program and the user is found in the same place.
